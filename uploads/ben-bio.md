I'll start! My name is Ben Miller, and I'm an associate professor and director of the Composition program in the English department. In addition to Composing Digital Media I've taught Composition Studies, Writing with Style, and Writing with Data, plus a bunch of sections of Seminar in Composition. This is my tenth year (wow!) at Pitt.

I co-edited an academic collection on Composition and Big Data, and I'm a founding editor of the [Journal of Interactive Technology and Pedagogy](http://jitpedagogy.org), where I'm often called upon to edit both CSS stylesheets and articles-in-progress. My book *[Distant Readings of Disciplinarity: Knowing and Doing in Composition-Rhetoric Dissertations](https://upcolorado.com/utah-state-university-press/item/6234-distant-readings-of-disciplinarity)* came out in 2022 from Utah State University Press. I'm still pretty psyched!

My sound from home: theme songs from Naruto.

My digital tool: [Zotero](https://zotero.org) bibliographic management software.

There's more, but maybe that's enough for now! I'm very much looking forward to this semester: I've thought a lot about where it might go, but I've taught enough by now to realize that it's all going to change when we get into it together. I can't wait to see where we end up!
