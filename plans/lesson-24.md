**Plan for the day**:

<!-- 1. Guidelines for final reflections -->
1. Think for yourself
2. Think with others
3. Make a plan
    * Tasks and roles for the project overall
    * Goals for just today
4. Studio time

<!-- could talk about final reflections now instead of next class -->

## Think for yourself

<div class="alert alert-success">If you haven't yet done so, please add a brief consolidation/integration brainstorm to <a href="https://bit.ly/cdm{{site.course.slugterm}}-notes">the google doc, in the space I showed you at the end of last class</a>; it could be as short as 1-3 sentences. What would you like to work on with your remaining time in CDM?</div>

Take just five minutes here; you'll have more time to flesh it out over the rest of today's class.

EXT: If you've already posted, head into the next section.


## Think with others

Now that you've spent some time discovering your thoughts about this final unit for yourself, it's time to share with others – and, possibly, to recruit or join up with some like-minded co-travelers.

<div class="alert alert-success">
<p>Still in the <a href="https://bit.ly/cdm{{site.course.slugterm}}-notes#heading=h.leh3pxuj6n6n">shared google doc</a>, <strong>read through the project brainstorms from your classmates</strong>.</p>
<p>Add polite clarifying questions using the Comments feature – or offer your services, if you'd like to form a team!</p>
</div>

We'll spend a while looping around and back in the margins or aloud.

When we're reaching a stable point, I'll ask you to record your team memberships (including solo teams), also in the google doc.


## Planning: tasks and roles

With your team (which may have one member, or more), get to planning. You'll need to have...

1. A brief **overview** of your baseline project goals, which may be revised from an initial pitch (especially if you're combining) or may be the initial pitch (if you're happy with it)
2. A list of smaller **tasks** you'll need to accomplish to achieve those goals
    - You can nest these as a bulleted list under your overview.
    - It's also quite possible you'll want a nested list. Look for the corners of the puzzle to complete so it doesn't get overwhelming.
    - You may want to mark additional _aspirational_ targets. What's your minimum deliverable product, vs your stretch goals beyond that?
3. If you have a team of two or more, proposed **roles** for each of your team members
    - [Last class](lesson-23#roles-and-reflection-15-min) I'd floated these possible roles: project manager, visual designer, experience designer, programmer, researcher, copy writer. Feel free to start there or adjust as needed.
    - You may also decide it would help to read through [this excerpt from _Writer/Designer_](https://pitt-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/millerb_pitt_edu/EWCA_Mf-WlVOhdrDM0Qi-LwBF2ej1e93f13CS5qhgNhVNg?e=vKhpBC), on ways to facilitate group collaboration.
4. A **link** to some space where you'll develop the project: most likely an existing GitHub repository or a new one.


<div class="alert alert-success">
<p>Please <strong>post these plans to the <a href="https://bit.ly/cdm{{site.course.slugterm}}-notes">google doc</a> by the end of today's class.</strong> If you're starting a new repo, they could also go in your new README.</p>
<!--
<p>Please use the section below the names so I can more easily scoop up the group memberships for Thursday's Zoom rooms. I also recommend posting a copy of your plan in your project's README – but don't forget to post that link where I can find it!</p> -->
</div>


## Studio time

If you're ready to move on and time allows, I'll get out of your way. :¬)

### Choose a subset of your goals for today

As is our custom, please [write down _today's_ goals](https://bit.ly/cdm{{site.course.slugterm}}-notes#heading=h.oote2j8rs4ib) for in-class time at the beginning of your work session, and expect to come back at the end with an update:
* Of the tasks you've listed, which can you achieve in class today?
* If none, how will you use class time to set yourself up for success moving forward? (See below for some possible reading you could do.)  


I'll float around, as usual.

<div class="alert alert-info">
Don't forget that there are some pre-compiled <a href="../resources">Resources</a> that might be useful... and please let me know if you find any more to share!
</div>

### Exit note

Five minutes before the end of class, please loop back to the google doc and make an updated plan: what do you want to have finished for Monday? By Wednesday, when we next have class?


## Homework for next time

<div class="alert alert-danger"><span style="color: #c51100;">Reminder: Ben will be traveling next week because of Passover, so Monday's class and office hours (April 14) are <em>canceled</em>.</span></div>

* **Continue** with whatever work you set out for yourself to consolidate, integrate, and ideally deepen your learning this semester.
* Post a **preview** – a beginning – to the repo you linked to in today's class.
  - If you're revising, this means you should **push at least one new commit.**
  - I'm going by project, not person, so teams should divide the labor appropriately... and hold each other to the agreements you've made.

EXT: If you haven't yet done so, please do read Paul Ford on git logs and read back through your own commit history – part of the homework from [last class](lesson-23#homework-for-next-time).

EXT: Have you also considered reading back through your studio goals and reflections in [the google doc](http://bit.ly/cdm{{site.course-slugterm}}-notes)? What about the [lesson plans](../schedule) – perhaps especially all those advice blocks from studio days?
