## Unit I: Digital Media Stacks
{: .unit #unit-1 }

_In this unit, we'll introduce **affordances** and **iteration** as recurring ways to think about digital products and processes – both those we encounter and those we create._

<h3>Wednesday, Jan 8 – <a href="plans/lesson-01" id="lesson-01">Lesson 1</a> – Introductions</h3>
HW for next time includes lots of little things:

* Surveys and sharing:
  - **Complete** two short [modules on Canvas]({{site.canvas_url}}/modules), about self- and community-care and the grading contract. This includes a short "quiz" (should take just a minute or two) and a chance to propose changes or adopt the contract.
  - **Read** the [rest of the syllabus]({{site.github_url}}/uploads/miller--syllabus-with-grading-contract--composing-digital-media--{{site.course.slugterm}}.pdf) – or read through the course website, which contains the same information in a different format.
  - **Respond** to the [Tech Comfort Survey](http://bit.ly/cdm2021survey) if you haven't yet done so.
* Written introduction to the people in the class:
  - **Join** [GitHub](https://github.com/) if you haven't yet (you can use your Pitt email to get [free private repositories](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/student_application)!),
  - **and post** an introduction to yourself on <a href="{{site.github.issues_url}}/1">the issue queue</a>.
* Prep software for next class:
  - **Download and install** the [GitHub Desktop application](https://desktop.github.com)
  - If you don't already have one, please **download and install** a plain text editor with syntax highlighting. If you don't have a preference, try either the open source **[Pulsar Editor](https://pulsar-edit.dev/)** or Microsoft's **[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** or, which runs on PC, Mac, and Linux. (Chromebook users might try [Caret](http://thomaswilburn.net/caret/), though note that Chromebooks might have trouble with some of the multimedia editing software coming up; talk to me about options if this is your main device.)
    - Especially if you don't know what "syntax highlighting" is, I recommend this [7-minute intro to VS Code](https://youtu.be/B-s71n0dHUk).


<h3>Monday, Jan 13 – <a href="plans/lesson-02" id="lesson-02">Lesson 2</a> – Interfaces and Repositories</h3>

HW for next time:

* **Read** and **watch** two versions of "Five Principles of New Media: Or, Playing Lev Manovich," by Madeleine Sorapure: a [text-only version](https://kairos.technorhetoric.net/8.2/binder2.html?coverweb/sorapure/index.htm) and a [video recording of the original Flash site](https://sorapure.net/five.mp4) (now defunct); run time is 22:24 at 1x speed.
* **Write** a short blog post: What do you notice? What do you wonder? _What can and can't text do in this context?_ Post this on the appropriate <a href="{{site.github.issues_url}}">Issues</a> thread.

* EXT for eager readers: interested in more on affordances? Try [this short chapter](https://wac.colostate.edu/docs/books/design/chapter7.pdf) from *Keywords in Design Thinking*.



<h3>Wednesday, Jan 15 – <a href="plans/lesson-03" id="lesson-03">Lesson 3</a> – Digital Affordances</h3>
<!-- Be sure to clarify that what you want is a single folder and a single file, so you can track its evolution. Some people always seem to want to create new repos for each draft, which defeats the purpose. -->

For next time, some intellectual stimulation...

* **Listen** to example audio narratives (see lesson plan for links)
* **Read** the excerpt from *Writer/Designer* on assets and fair use, plus (optionally) a webcomic on Creative Commons.
* **Write** a short blog post: what do you notice? what do you wonder? Post this on <a href="{{site.github.issues_url}}">the Issues page</a>.

... and some nuts-and-bolts preparation:

* **Download** the [Audacity 3.7](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/) audio editor if you haven't yet, or update to the latest version if you already have it.
  * *Optionally* also download the [separate FFmpeg import/export library](https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/faq_installing_the_ffmpeg_import_export_library.html), which may help if you're using your phone to record audio
* **Watch** [Audacity Basics: Recording, Editing, Mixing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im2W7pokfpw) by Kyle Stedman (run time 18:20 at 1x speed) and come in ready to play with the software – and ask any questions that come up
<!-- Ben HW: bring in sounds to practice with -->
<!-- * **Schedule** a one-on-one conference with Ben using https://benmiller314.youcanbook.me -->


<h3>Monday, Jan 20 – no class (Martin Luther King, Jr. Day)</h3>


## Unit II: Soundscapes and Soundwriting
{: .unit #unit-2}

*In this unit, you’ll arrange layers of sound to project a sense of place, and of things happening in that place. The genre of the narrative is open: it could be documentary, fictional, even science-fictional. (The title you choose will help steer listeners' expectations, and thus their perceptions.)*

<a id="current"/>
<h3>Wednesday, Jan 22 – <a href="plans/lesson-04" id="lesson-04">Lesson 4</a> – Audacity; Sound On, Sound Off<!-- discuss posts. skip demo, b/c the video already covered this! jump straight to playing with audacity. end with generative writing toward a proposal -->
<!-- Re: playing with Audacity: instead of representative and reprehensible sampling, what if we practice looping and alignment?-->
</h3>

For next time:

* **Read and listen** to the audio recording advice (Fowkes and MacAdam; see lesson plan)
* **Review** the piece on fair use and open licensing from last week if you need a refresher.
* **Write** a _proposal_ for your audio narrative, including a prospective asset list (as per *W/D*); post to <a href="{{site.github.issues_url}}">the Issues page</a>.
<!-- * **Listen to and record** a piece of your local soundscape THIS IS GOOD, BUT I JUST DON'T HAVE TIME IN THE SPRING -->
* **Begin** sourcing the sounds you'll need
* **Bring** headphones so you can work in class


<h3>Monday, Jan 27 – <a href="plans/lesson-05" id="lesson-05">Lesson 5</a> – Recording, Ethics, Studio<!-- reading comprehension, general proposal advice, but mostly studio so they can turn in a preview by next class.Allow a few minutes to discuss GenAI ethics in the context of audio, and "royalty free" vs open licensed. Is there time for a name game? If not, do it next class.  --></h3>


For next time:

* **Skim** the audio resources on the site, and read more deeply in anything that seems like it would help you.
  - Audacity itself has a ton of documentation on their site: see [support.audacityteam.org/](https://support.audacityteam.org/).
  - Search is also good! It's how I find these things, after all. But remember that a Large Language Model like ChatGPT or Gemini's AI Overview is not, in itself, a search; it's attempting to recreate and consolidate language it's found elsewhere. Look for the sources so you can see more clearly how to adapt advice from their context to your own.
* **Push** a _audio narrative preview_ including
  - the layered Audacity file (.aup3), named for reusability throughout your project (i.e. don't call it "preview")
  - at least one screenshot of your work in progress (.png)
  - one exported playable sound file (.mp3)
  - a brief description of what you've included, as part of your README.md file.


<h3>Wednesday, Jan 29 – <a href="plans/lesson-06" id="lesson-06">Lesson 6</a> – Sound Unit Criteria and Stretch Goals</h3>

For next time:
* **Work** toward the baseline criteria for your audio narrative
* **Continue** taking screenshots and posting meaningful commits to GH
* **Push** a *full draft*, with the same four parts as the preview *plus* a file crediting your sources and permissions/license to use them. This can be part of the README or a separate file (e.g. sources.md) that your README will ideally link to.
* **Bring** headphones so you can work in class


<h3>Monday, Feb 3 – <a href="plans/lesson-07" id="lesson-07">Lesson 7</a> – Sound Workshop</h3>

For next time:

* Continue to **save, commit, and push** toward your project, incorporating feedback from partners.
    - If you didn't get feedback, please **let me know** asap!
    - If you haven't finished *giving* feedback, please do so asap, and no later than noon on Wednesday for full credit.
* Optionally, **write** a blog post of possible integrative projects for the final unit of the class. What more might you want to explore? Or what do you know you won't have time for now, but maybe could look into and build toward by the end of the term?
* **Bring** headphones so you can work in class


<h3>Wednesday, Feb 5 – <a href="plans/lesson-08" id="lesson-08">Lesson 8</a> – Sound Studio</h3>

For next time:

* **By 10:00pm on Sunday,** complete – at least for now – your audio narrative.
* **By noon on Monday,** post a prose reflection to <a href="{{site.github.issues_url}}">the issue queue</a> that incorporates screenshots of your feedback and of your Audacity project as it developed.
    - Annotations on these screenshots are optional but I've found them helpful in the past, and you might, too.



## Unit III: Visual Rhetorics and Argument
{: .unit #unit-3}

*In this unit, you will make a rhetorical intervention (a claim) through the juxtaposition of images and text. As with the sound project, the context for your argument is open: you could be making a social commentary, calling for action, constructing a parody, riffing on a pun, explaining a concept, and so on. Whatever you choose, you should consider your audience and what they would find persuasive, interesting, or memorable, and how you therefore wish to attract and direct their attention.*

<h3>Monday, Feb 10 – <a href="plans/lesson-09" id="lesson-09">Lesson 9</a> – Can You Picture It? Visual Rhetorics and Argument</h3> <!-- Introduce unit assignment; start hw reading in class, if possible; add discussion of AI Weirdness around revision. DO read the original post by Dani Rose. -->

For next time:

* **Read** a quick introduction to graphic design principles <!-- and the in-class reading, if you missed it or want more time --> (see lesson plan)
* **Find** an example of a rhetorical visual design (on your own)
* **Write** a post about your example on the relevant <a href="{{site.github.issues_url}}">issue queue</a>, using the analytical language from the reading

<h3>Wednesday, Feb 12 – <a href="plans/lesson-10" id="lesson-10">Lesson 10</a> – Generating Visual Ideas</h3> <!-- practice vocab by analyzing examples of past student projects: emphasize emphasis; design vs. intervention; audience addressed, audience invoked. end with Perl-esque guidelines -->

For next time:

* **Skim** the visual media [resources]({{site.github_url}}/resources) on the course site, and read/watch more deeply in anything that seems like it would help you.
    - In particular, I highly recommend the LinkedIn Learning series of videos on "GIMP Essential Training." It's about *5* hours of material, which I'm not expecting you to view all of in one weekend (though you do you): as before, [I've marked some highlights and starting points]({{site.github_url}}/resources#lil-gimp). I've been using GIMP for years, and I confess I learned some things even from the basic tool options videos. Note that there are exercise files, should you want to follow along and make sure it works in practice.<!-- - If you've been having trouble with LinkedIn Learning, try [this LIL link, which routes through MyPitt](https://my.pitt.edu/launch-task/all/cssd-linkedinlearning?terms=linkedin&roles=). I also am happy to troubleshoot with you during office hours! -->
* **Write** a visual argument _proposal_, including a prospective asset list and a rough sketch; post to <a href="{{site.github.issues_url}}">the issue queue</a>
* **Bring** headphones for <a href="https://www.noisli.com/">sonic isolation</a>, if you'd like

<h3>Monday, Feb 17 – <a href="plans/lesson-11" id="lesson-11">Lesson 11</a> – Generative Studio</h3>
<!-- Open class with guidance re: proposals -->
<!-- NEW AFTER 2023 SPRING: help students choose reasonable canvas sizes by looking into the defaults for new files when you tour the software. -->
For next time:

* **Compose and push** a visual argument _preview_; get it started, see how it feels to work with these tools/materials. A workshop-ready draft due in one week.
* (Weekend reading, should you want it / have more time now: **Read** about fonts<!-- https://trydesignlab.com/blog/how-to-choose-the-right-font-for-your-design/ is part 2, but parts 1 and 3 are less essential. Other links within part 2 are EXT for eager readers. -->, optionally playing a font-matching game<!-- http://www.typeconnection.com/ -->)


<h3>Wednesday, Feb 19 – <a href="plans/lesson-12" id="lesson-12">Lesson 12</a> – Visual Unit Criteria and Stretch Goals</h3>

For next time:

* **Read** about fonts<!-- https://trydesignlab.com/blog/how-to-choose-the-right-font-for-your-design/ is part 2, but parts 1 and 3 are less essential. Other links within part 2 are EXT for eager readers. -->, optionally playing a font-matching game <!-- http://www.typeconnection.com/ -->
* **Work** toward baseline criteria for your visual argument / rhetorical collage
* **Compose and push** a workshop-ready *full draft*


<h3>Monday, Feb 24 – <a href="plans/lesson-13" id="lesson-13">Lesson 13</a> – Visual Unit Workshop</h3>

For next time:
* Continue to **save, commit, and push** toward your project, incorporating feedback from partners.
    - If you didn't get feedback, please **let me know** asap!
    - If you haven't finished *giving* feedback, please do so asap, and no later than noon on Wednesday for full credit.
* *Optionally*, **write** a post on the <a href="{{site.github.issues_url}}">issue queue</a> with more ideas toward the final / integrative project unit. What further possibilities might you want to explore? Or what do you know you won't have time for now, but maybe could look into and build toward by the end of the term?
* **Bring** headphones for <a href="https://www.noisli.com/">sonic isolation</a>, if you'd like

<h3>Wednesday, Feb 26 – <a href="plans/lesson-14" id="lesson-14">Lesson 14</a> – Revision Studio</h3>

For next time:

* **By 10:00pm on Sunday,** complete – at least for now – your visual argument. <!-- Unless people want to work through break... -->
* By **noon on Monday,** post a prose reflection to <a href="{{site.github.issues_url}}">the issue queue</a> that incorporates screenshots of your feedback and of your project workspace as it developed.
    - Annotations on these screenshots are optional but I've found them helpful in the past, and you might, too.
<!-- BEN HW: Choose sample student website projects to assign. Focus on work by people without prior experience – including Lynn Priestley's tea shop -->


<div class="alert alert-warning">
<strong>Spring break!</strong> No classes on March 3rd or 5th. NB: If you need to <a href="https://www.cgs.pitt.edu/advising/withdrawal-courses">withdraw</a> from any class, forms are due by email no later than end-of-business on Tuesday, March 11.
</div>


## Unit IV: Webslinging (HTML + CSS markup)
{: .unit #unit-4}

*In this unit, you will build a multi-page website from scratch, beginning with html, css, and images, to explore the affordances of the web design stack as a medium, and especially its ability to flexibly render content for multiple audiences or reading priorities.*

<h3>Monday, Mar 10 – <a href="plans/lesson-15" id="lesson-15">Lesson 15</a> – Midterm Reflections and Generative Writing </h3> <!-- Generative loop writing: what are the collections & categories of things you've made? Things you'd want to make? Offline sketching NOTES FOR SPRING 2023: **encourage mobile-first sketching!** -->

For next time:

* Review sample student website projects
* Consider the collections of work you might want to gather
* **Write** a _website proposal_, including at least one hand-drawn design sketch, types of pages, a prospective asset list, and a link to your repo. Post to the <a href="{{site.github.issues_url}}">issue queue</a>.


<h3>Wednesday, Mar 12 – <a href="plans/lesson-16" id="lesson-16">Lesson 16</a> – Intro to Markup and Web Design</h3>
<!--
BEN HW:
  * Record and post screencast on <nav><ul><li><a>, removing bullets, and resizing with padding. Then update the HW for after break to include this.
  * Record and post a screencast of building a CSS layout from an offline sketch
-->

For next time:

<!-- NEW AFTER 2023spring: Add semantic HTML tutorial now instead of later! -->

* *Optional* If you haven't yet, spend some time getting to know your plain-text editor.
  - Can it show two or more files side by side? Can it preview how an html file will render? Does it allow plugins or extensions to enable either of those things?
  - If you're using VSCode, you may want to check out some [intro tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj6YeMhvp2S5UgiQnBfvD7XgOMKs3O_G6). I also recommend this list of [HTML-specific features and optional settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/html).
* **Do** as much of the [Interneting is Hard (but it doesn't have to be)](https://internetingishard.netlify.app/html-and-css/) tutorial as you have time for – but **at least parts 1-4** (from Introduction through Hello, CSS).
    - EXT for speedy workers: if you want to keep going, do The Box Model (part 5), then skip ahead to Semantic HTML before looping back to CSS Selectors, then Web Typography. Beyond that, use links below from our class schedule for things like responsive layout.
    - Why? Float layouts used to be a big deal, but they're not recommended now that we have better tools in Flexbox and Grid – and better tutorials for those, as well.
* **Show your work** by pushing your tutorial code to your project repository.
  * Start by copying the pages as written, before attempting to adapt to your own work: confirm that you can get them to look the same as in the tutorial.
  * If your pages *aren't* working the same as in the tutorial, please do check with me! I'll set aside some breakout group time when we get back, but feel free to email or use the [issue queue]({{site.github.issues_url}}) in the meantime: see if your question's been answered, and if not, [post a new issue]({{site.github.issues_url}}/new/choose), because you're probably not alone.

<!-- * *Optionally* bring headphones for sonic isolation during studio time -->


<h3>Monday, Mar 17 – <a href="plans/lesson-17" id="lesson-17">Lesson 17</a> – Studio / Stylesheeting </h3>

<!--

EXT: Self-paced tutorialing, using the lessons to build prelim pages of your own. That is, once you have the tutorial working, try swapping in your own content for the tutorial's: an about page, an image or two, a linked credits page. And if not today, then Thursday

NEW AFTER 2020fall: Troubleshoot with Ben in a breakout room if your content doesn't work like the tutorial's.

NEW AFTER 2023spring: Suggest the Web Typography lesson as an EXT, and then as a priority for in-class work next class.

-->

* **Do** more of the [Internetingishard tutorial](https://internetingishard.netlify.app/html-and-css/), including at least The Box Model, Semantic HTML (skip down), and CSS Selectors (skip back up) if you haven't yet.
    - EXT for speedy workers: after CSS Selectors, jump down to Web Typography. Beyond that, use links below from our class schedule for things like responsive layout. The rest of the Internetingishard tutorial is best saved as advanced or historical topics beyond what I'll assign across the rest of the unit.
* **Read** more about [how CSS selectors work](https://css-tricks.com/how-css-selectors-work/) *OR* if you prefer game-based learning to straight-up reading, try loading and clearing plates at the [CSS Diner](https://flukeout.github.io/). (There's still reading, in the sidebar, which tells you how to win the round.)
<!-- * **View** screencast on using <nav><ul><li></a> and CSS to remove bullets ... and to resize the <a> directly using padding. Point out that this is a direct application of the Box Model. -->


<h3>Wednesday, Mar 19 – <a href="plans/lesson-18" id="lesson-18">Lesson 18</a> – Studio / Navigation</h3>

<!-- Make sure everyone knows how to make a navigation menu using <nav><ul><li><a>. -->

For next time:

* **View** Kevin Powell's video on [5 simple tips to making responsive layouts the easy way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQraviuwbzU&list=PL4-IK0AVhVjM6kuUoUexfmnD8vHtZkXdd&index=4) (runtime: 15:53 at 1x speed)
* **Do** the Internetingishard tutorial on Web Typography if you haven't yet.
    - Remember your resources on fonts from the previous unit? They can help you here, too!
* **Compose and push** a _first draft_ of your website: a beginning, focused on html content and mobile (i.e. minimal) design.


<h3>Monday, Mar 24 – <a href="plans/lesson-19" id="lesson-19">Lesson 19</a> – Web Unit Studio / Deployment</h3>

<!--
* Make sure everyone has successfully activated GitHub Pages before they leave.
  - Note that the landing page has to be called index.html. You can always change the <title>.
  - Note that the instructions at  https://pages.github.com/ are confusing, because we *don't want to create a whole new repo.*

* Self-paced tutorial-ing / applications of tutorial to your own content
* Troubleshoot with Ben in a breakout room if your content doesn't work like the tutorial's.
-->

For next time:

* **Read** Josh Comeau's [Interactive Guide to Flexbox](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/) and [Interactive Guide to CSS Grid](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-grid/)
    - EXT: Want some layout templates and examples? Try Powell's follow-up video on some common patterns, [Useful & Responsive Layouts, no Media Queries required](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3_xN2Zp1TY).
    - EXT: Want even *more* layout templates and examples? Try Rachel Andrew's [Grid By Example](https://gridbyexample.com/patterns/), which also has video tutorials.<!-- * **Test** your skills with https://flexboxfroggy.com/  - As a reminder, you should **write out the exercises in the tutorials** and push them to your repository – probably in the tutorials subfolder. Once you have them working as presented, feel free to update them to test out ideas for your own site! But do try to confirm you can get them working first. HTML, like all code, is fiddly: punctuation (including spaces) matters for things like close-tags and CSS selectors. -->
* **Compose and push** a _second draft_, now adding or updating desktop layout.
    - **Email me with any questions**, noting that I can help fastest if you include screenshots and links to your site/repo. Better yet, [create a New Issue]({{site.github.issues_url}}/new/choose)! Then my answer to you can help others, too.
<!-- A full, workshop-ready draft of your website project is due in one week. -->

<h3>Wednesday, Mar 26 – <a href="plans/lesson-20" id="lesson-20">Lesson 20</a> – Web Unit Criteria and Stretch Goals / Studio</h3>

<!--
* Model building a design from a hand-drawn sketch.
* Self-paced tutorial-ing / applications of tutorial to your own content, in breakouts
* Q&A with Ben, especially if your tutorials aren't working as expected.
* Remind people that local file paths aren't going to work! Show them the browser extension for replacing images with their alt text / detecting accessibility problems.
-->
For next time:

* **Work** toward baseline criteria for your website portfolio.
* **Compose and push** a workshop-ready *full draft* of your project.
  * If you're doing something advanced (Jekyll, React, etc) that will require a server and not just a browser, be sure to **explain in your repo's README.md file how to load your files**.
  * If you haven't already done so in class, test that your website portfolio is ready for your workshop partners to download: **try to clone it again to a new location** on your computer: if you can successfully open your pages in a local browser from that second location, you should be good to get feedback even from an asynchronous workshop.
    - (You should then also <em>delete that extra copy</em>, before you get confused as to where you're revising and pushing from.)

<h3>Monday, Mar 31 – <a href="plans/lesson-21" id="lesson-21">Lesson 21</a> – Web Unit Workshop </h3>
For next time:

* Optionally, **write** one more blog post about what you'd like to do in our final / integrative unit. What further possibilities might you want to explore? Or what do you know you won't have time for now, but maybe could look into and build toward by the end of the term? NB: If you're interested in finding people to collaborate with, this is a good time to make a pitch!
    - Post this to <a href="{{site.github.issues_url}}">the issue queue</a>, as usual
* Continue to **save, commit, and push** toward your project, incorporating feedback from partners.
    - If you didn't get feedback, please **let me know** asap!
    - If you haven't finished *giving* feedback, please do so asap, and no later than noon on Wednesday for full credit.

<!-- <div class="alert alert-danger">
<span style="color: #c51100;">Heads up: This will be a <strong>fully asynchronous</strong> workshop. See lesson plan for details, but please try to leave your feedback <em>by Thursday morning if possible</em>, so your classmates have the studio time to revise with your input in mind.

## Unit V: Putting it Together (Bit by Bit)<a href="https://youtu.be/rJFz-ucuTvs?t=328"><span class="hidden">*</span><sup>*</sup></a>
{: .unit #unit-5}

*In this final unit I'll ask you to build on what you've already made: a revision, extension, or combination of the modes and media you used in earlier units. If you have a team (up to 3 people) that can collaborate effectively, go for it. It's a short sprint to the end of term, so scope your ambitions accordingly!*

<!-- <p>If you're feeling especially aspirational, might I suggest that a game or interactive story built in <a href="https://twinery.org">Twine</a> might serve that combinatory goal quite well? I'll see what I'm able to screen-record by way of introduction / guidance.</p> -->

  * **Read** Paul Ford's short "Letter of Recommendation: Bug Fixes" from <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/magazine/letter-of-recommendation-bug-fixes-git.html">The New York Times Magazine</a></em> (June 11, 2019). ([Pitt Library link](http://pitt.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.pitt.idm.oclc.org/docview/2237787684))
  * Ford writes, "I read the change logs, and I think: <em>Humans can do things.</em>" **Read back** through your own change logs, i.e. the commit histories of your projects; skim through the lesson plans; maybe even review your studio goals and exit notes. What things have you done this semester? What have you wanted to do, but not yet done?
* *Preparing one final project or revision:*
  * Work through the questions in the lesson plan's EXT, if you didn't yet, to develop an informal _project pitch_ and **post it** to our [shared google doc](https://bit.ly/cdm{{site.course.slugterm}}-notes). (The doc, rather than the issue queue, will make it easier for potential collaborators to annotate and for you to edit together in our next class.)


<h3>Wednesday, Apr 9 – <a href="plans/lesson-24" id="lesson-24">Lesson 24</a> – Consolidation Unit Pitch Market and Studio</h3><!-- #4c25 workshops today: travel after class? You present Thursday afternoon, Pesach starts Saturday -->

For next time:

* *Preparing one final project or revision:*
    - **Meet** with any groupmates (or set some time for yourself) and **set** some explicit goals, with notes on who will take lead on what. Write these notes down and see below.
    - Create a repository, if need be, or choose an existing project repository if you will mainly revise. Add a link to the repo to your planning document.
    - **Post** this plan to the <a href="{{site.github.issues_url}}">the issue queue</a> by in lieu of a _project preview_

<div class="alert alert-danger"><span style="color: #c51100;">NB: Ben will be traveling next week because of Passover, so Monday's class and office hours (April 14) will be <em>canceled</em>.</span></div>


<h3>Monday, Apr 14 – No class (Passover)</h3>

For next time:

* Keep in touch with your groupmates (if relevant) and move forward with your plan.

<h3>Wednesday, Apr 16 – <a href="plans/lesson-25" id="lesson-25">Lesson 25</a> – Consolidation Unit Studio / Preparing the Final Reflective Letter </h3>

For next time:

* Check in with the calendar and update your deadlines: what are you trying to finish by the last class (in five days!)? Will you continue beyond that, knowing the final portfolio is due soon?
* Continue updating and following your work plan.
* **Push** a project update (i.e. maybe not a finished draft, but closer) to your repository.
* **Document your progress** as you go! Screenshot, save, commit (or otherwise log changes), push, repeat.
* _Optional_: **choose** something from the course that you want to remember beyond this semester: a thing you or someone else made, or said, that struck a chord with you. We'll share these in the last class.


<h3>Monday, Apr 21 – <a href="plans/lesson-26" id="lesson-26">Lesson 26</a> – Last day of class! Looking back and looking forward</h3>

<div class="footnote-block" style="margin-top:3em;">

<p class="footnote"><a href="#ftnref1" id="ftn1">[1]</a> This early deadline is not my way of being mean; it's just that sometimes things will take longer than you expect, and I'd really like for you to be able to sleep, and for me to be able to look over your work in the morning before class. Those latter two things are the real priorities that the "night before" policy is meant to achieve. <a href="#ftnref1"><em>~jump back~</em></a></p>

<!-- <p class="footnote"><a href="#ftnref2" id="ftn2">[2]</a> If you're updating an existing project, I recommend doing this in a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/managing-branches">new branch</a> of the old repository, instead. <a href="#ftnref2"><em>~jump back~</em></a></p> -->
