# Audacity; Sound On, Sound Off

Welcome to Unit II!

**Work to have done:**

* Fork and clone the [audio narrative repository](https://github.com/benmiller314/audio-narrative-{{site.course.slugterm}}) so you have your own workspace, linked to the others
* Download [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/) and watch a brief video on [Audacity Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im2W7pokfpw)


## Plan for the day

1. GitHub: Attack of the Clones (~10 min)
2. Into Audacity (25-35 min)
3. Share and Enjoy (5-10 min)
4. Generative writing (10 min, start no later than 1:50)
5. HW Preview (5 min)
EXT. Studio time


## 1. Sound, space, and attention

<!-- Have Tyller's and Jackie's pieces open from the beginning, so you can illustrate points by demoing what they've done (e.g. soloing or muting). -->

I was reviewing the posts on the forum as they relate specifically to the audio narratives. Lots of great observations there! Here are a few themes I wanted to highlight:

<details><summary>Audio engages by being immersive</summary>

<p>A number of posts noted the way you felt you were <em>in</em> the coffeeshop, or the haunted house, or the apartment making dinner. Diego put it most dramatically: "When listening to 'Coffee Shop Conversations' I felt transported. If I closed my eyes I could imagine I were there."</p>

<p>A large part of this immersion, as Ben (Adams) usefully deconstructed it, is that we use our ears to orient ourselves in space: in "Come Over For Dinner," "we hear the fire alarm more predominantly in our right ear at first. After a few blares, the sound of the alarm eventually shifts equally to both ears, growing in volume, before the fire alarm stops making noise." When we hear a new sound more in one ear than the other, we're attuned to turn toward it, to balance it out.<a id="ftnref1" class="ftnref" href="ftn1" title="Later, I'll remind you from this same principle that two speakers are unlikely to be at 100% left or 100% right; even if you're walking between them, you'll probably turn at least partway toward them while they're talking. Try 60% and see how it goes.">[1]</a> (As we do so, other sounds may shift from balanced to peripheral.) In this sense, Ben notes, the piece "is in a first-person perspective; our ears are that of the main character's." This works best with headphones, of course, but even over speakers relative differences in volume can convey relative distance.</p> <!-- Show -->

</details>

<details><summary>Continuous background conveys a consistent place/time</summary>
<p>Lauren, writing about "Coffee Shop Conversations," pointed out that "the overlapped sounds of miscellaneous conversations, keyboard clicking of laptops, and jazz music playing" worked to quickly establish the setting.</p>

<p>Ariana took a similar point even further, also noting the realism of the opening soundscape – but then highlighting the way we leave the coffee shop for an imagined outer space when "that conversation was brought to the foreground, and the coffee shop noises were put into the background [...] the blurring out of all the other noises and echo effect made the listener feel the conversation in real time, like you were in space while hearing the conversation about space."</p>

<p>Relatedly, many podcasts and radio shows also use short musical interludes to smooth changes from one "act" or segment to another: the music provides continuity across the gap.</p> <!-- Try turning off the music... then the chatter... then the ambient hum. -->
</details>

<details><summary>Contrasting sound draws attention</summary>
<p>The opposite of the previous point is that abrupt changes in background can be used to create a sense of a scene change, or a jump forward in time. For one example, Kellen noted the way "the music entirely went away right before the characters started running in 'The King of the Jungle.' " Asher, similarly, noted the introduction of the squeaky door to convey movement from outside to inside the house in "A Haunted Halt."</p>

<p>But, more mundanely, incidental sounds like chopping, cash registers, or broken glass, give us a sense of time passing – of something happening. These "events" drew a lot of attention in your comments. And this makes sense: one definition of narrative is <em>interruption of a stable context</em>, and the fallout of that interruption. When sounds recur or extend, they create a stable context, yes – but one we can break. ;&nbsp;)</p>

<p>The flip side of this is that a long time <em>without</em> a change can drain attention: it's often harder to get away with very long clips than with very short ones. (And the same might be said of paragraphs, let's not forget!)</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Emotional effects come from layering</summary>

<p>Suchi pointed out the way the whole is crafted from overlapping parts: "As I listened I found myself picking layers of the audio, separating and isolating sounds like the pouring of coffee, chatter of people, question asked by a character, the background jazz music as they all happened at the same moment."</p>

<p>Ariana noted the emotional signals music can provide: "The consistent classical background music also seems fitting as one thinks about coffee and coffee shops as a calming space," despite the fact that "with how busy they get, they can create a chaotic environment."</p>

<p>Asher, likewise, noted the way horror genre elements &ndash; the "squeaky doors and echoing footsteps," along with the low-pitched hum and whispered dialogue &ndash; can do "an amazing job [...] to paint a scene," even when they're a little cliche. Listeners' familiarity with the genre can add its own depth when their expectations are fulfilled. ...And then we can thwart them. ;&nbsp;)</p>

</details>




## 2. Into Audacity (25-35 min)


Last time, we talked about how the simultaneous layering of sound can have a powerful impact on how it's perceived. Today, I'd like you to play around with that power!

<details><summary>A fun example, albeit in video</summary>
<p>Remember this anxious arrival?</p>

I'll ask you all to work with the same materials, just for today. In the audio-narrative-{{site.course.slugterm}} repository that you just cloned, you'll find a folder labeled "in-class activity." That folder contains:

* A one-minute selection from President Biden's inaugural address;
* A handful of instrumental tracks I found on [CCmixter](http://dig.ccmixter.org/), a site for sharing music with explicit permission to use and (often) modify.
* The full credits for these sound files, in the file CREDITS.md.

<div class="alert alert-success">
Your task for the next 20 minutes or so is to try mixing, matching, splitting, sliding, realigning, and otherwise messing around with these tracks.
  <ol>
    <li>To get started, <strong>use File > Import > Audio...</strong> to pull in an mp3 from the in-class-activity folder.</li>
    <li>Play with the strategies from last class: how does the mood change as you change the soundtrack? The left/right mix? The alignment? The tempo?</li>
    <li>Experiment with what tools the context menus and track menus offer: what does Audacity <em>expect</em> you to want to do, based on what it makes readily available?</li>
    <li>Play with the Effects menus: some good starting points include fade in/out, repeat, change tempo, delay, low pass filter. Check the "manage" button in Effects dialog boxes to see if there are any presets to try, or the ? button to learn more about that particular effect.</li>
    <li>Try splitting the speech at moments of silence to extract individual words, using Edit > Clip Boundaries > Split (or Split New). (NB: we can also have some fun with reordering the words, but please don't push those doctored speeches to GitHub: we don't need any more fake news circulating!)</li>
    <li>etc</li>
  </ol>
</div>



<!-- I'll split the class into groups, so you can talk amongst yourselves as needed without it getting overwhelming.   -->

<!-- <div class="alert alert-info">
In general, <strong>when we're in breakout groups, I encourage you to unmute</strong> and have your cameras on – as long as your background sounds won't hog the microphone.
</div> -->

For this activity, headphones will help you isolate your Audacity playback from each other.

<!-- If/when you want to share, you can set the Audacity playback to "Zoom Audio Device," which you can do from the toolbar, as shown below. If you don't see that option, you may need to use the Transport menu to Rescan Audio Devices.

<figure>

<figcaption>By default, the output device taskbar sits just above the main track window, marked with the icon of a speaker. If you haven't changed it, it probably reads "Built-in Output."</figcaption>
</figure>

<div class="alert alert-warning">NB: If your computer can't handle both Zoom and Audacity, it's okay (not ideal, but okay) to drop out of the call for a few minutes while you're working. But do <strong>set a timer</strong>, so you can check back in after about 20 minutes.</div>
-->

<p>The <a href="">tutorial</a> I asked you to watch for homework should have given you the overview you need to jump in and get editing, but do call me in if you have questions!</p> <!-- You can use the "Ask for Help" button (<img src="https://assets.zoom.us/images/en-us/desktop/generic/in-meeting/ask-for-help-icon.png" alt="ask for help button, which shows a question mark in a circle" class="d-inline-block" />) in your meeting menu. -->


<p>EXT?: Audacity is complex enough that I'm really expecting you can fill the time here without an EXT: there are dozens of automatic effects, each with their own options and help pages! But if you're really happy with what you've achieved, go ahead and save the project, then mute the current music and add a different soundtrack. How does that shift your perception of the edits you'd already made? What else does it make you want to try?</p>


<h2>3. Share and Enjoy (5-10 min)</h2>

<p>I'd love to hear some of these, if time allows! </p>
<!-- Set your output device as shown above to play through Zoom. -->


<h3>Side note on saving: project files vs. rendered files</h3>

<p>**Audacity project files, with extension .aup3, are not playable in any program other than Audacity.** Strictly speaking, they're not actually sound files: they're a database *of* a large number of sound files, bundled together with the files themselves, plus information about track display sizes, whether they're muted, how much they're panned left or right, and so on.</p>

<p>(In fact, until Audacity 3.x, all these files and the index of metadata used to be separate. It's a mixed bag that they're not any more: on the one hand, it's harder to mess up. On the other, it makes that unified file a lot larger.)</p>

<p><strong>To make the file playable, you have to <em>render</em> it by using File &gt; Export As.</strong> You're probably fine to use .mp3 format for most purposes.</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
NB: I believe it'll export the whole file, across all layers, as long as nothing's selected - but it might try to export only your selection if something *is* selected when you start the export. Something to watch out for, at any rate.
</div>

<h2>4. Generative loop writing</h2>

<p>As you know, the project proposal is due by next class; it should include some basic premise of your narrative;
some sense of setting; a link to your project repository; and a table of potential assets like the one you read about in <em>Writer/Designer</em>.</p>

<p>To help you get there, I'd like to spend the remainder of our in-class time using writing – some listing and looping – as a way to get your ideas flowing. <strong>As I ask the following questions, pause and reach out with your feelings until you sense an answer, or more than one, and then write down whatever comes.</strong> I won't collect these, so they're private to you. But I hope you'll find them useful for getting to something shareable, moving forward.</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>In the process of writing with sound, you're going to spend a big chunk of time listening and relistening and looping, so you want to pick a place you're likely to enjoy hanging out in.</p>
  <p>What <em>places</em> (physical, virtual, or imaginary) come to mind as energizing for you to unpack into layers, and reassemble? In other words: within what <em>soundscapes</em> might you anchor your narrative? <strong>Make a list.</strong> Anything you're forgetting?</li>
  <li>Choosing one item from your list you could work with for now, ask yourself: How would you represent that <em>environment</em>sonically?
    <ul>
      <li>e.g. What sounds are relatively stable, or sustained, in that place? </li>
      <li>e.g. What incidental, or foreground, sounds do you associate with that place?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Still in the same environment: What kinds of <em>stories</em> happen there? Again, make a list. </li>
  <li>Look over your list of stories, and ask yourself: which of these could you reasonably tell within a few minutes? which are long enough to tell <em>for</em> a few minutes?</li>
  <li>Choosing one story to work with for now – you can always come back to other items on the list over the weekend – ask yourself:
    <ul>
      <li>What are the pieces of this story? What are the actions, structures, or sequences?</li>
      <li>How would you represent each action _for audio_? What sounds, signals, or setups could help a listening audience know what was happening?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>


<h2>EXT: Studio time</h2>

If we have more time left in class, go ahead and start writing up your proposal – or start testing the feasibility of what you want to propose, e.g. by searching for sounds you think you'll need, or opening further Audacity tutorials.

If we get up to this step, please go to our shared notes doc, [bit.ly/cdm{{site.course.slugterm}}-notes](http://bit.ly/cdm{{site.course.slugterm}}-notes) to set your working goals for today.

## Homework for next time

* The main writing assignment for the weekend is to <strong>post a proposal for your soundscape narrative by Tuesday</strong>, including a preliminary list of sound assets you might want to include.
  - To encourage cross-pollination, I'd like you to post these **to the [issue queue]({{site.github.issues_url}})**.
  - If you're feeling stuck on what to propose, see the <a title="Because you reach for them when you feel like you're falling">"parachute prompts"</a> at the bottom of the [project assignment](https://github.com/benmiller314/audio-narrative-{{site.course.slugterm}}#parachute-prompts).

* You also have some reading, as you know:
   * If you haven't yet looked at the chapter from  _Writer/Designer_ (Ball, Sheppard, and Arola, eds) on sources and credits, **please read it before writing your proposal.** A scan of the relevant chapter is <a title="not posted to preserve the limited distribution that helps justify my fair use claim (as does my colorless copy and the limited amount copied, relative to the book)" href="{{site.canvas_url}}/assignments/849366">posted to the Perusall social annotation software on Canvas</a>.
   * I'd also like you to **read** the following advice on sound recording, **listening to the embedded clips**:
     - Fowkes, Stuart. “The Top 5 Things You Need to Make a Great Field Recording.” *Cities & Memory: Field Recordings, Sound Map, Sound Art*, 13 Aug. 2014, [https://citiesandmemory.com/2014/08/top-5-things-need-make-great-field-recording/](https://citiesandmemory.com/2014/08/top-5-things-need-make-great-field-recording/).
     - MacAdam, Alison. “6 NPR Stories That Breathe Life into Neighborhood Scenes.” *NPR Training*, 30 Oct. 2015, [https://training.npr.org/audio/six-npr-stories-that-breathe-life-into-neighborhood-scenes/](https://training.npr.org/audio/six-npr-stories-that-breathe-life-into-neighborhood-scenes/). (**Note the time skips she recommends**: sometimes a long clip is embedded, but not meant to be listened to in full.)
  * Finally, I have some _optional_ further readings on Creative Commons and Fair Use. If Ball et al. struck a chord with you, here's where to read on!
    - A [short four-page webcomic](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Howitworks_Comic1) explaining how Creative Commons (CC) licenses get attached to copyrightable materials, and how easily CC materials can be included and/or remixed in further creations... with, at a minimum, attribution. The subject is covered in _Writer/Designer_, but the comic is cute.
    - The Stanford Overview of Fair Use, which you can find in a series of four webpages beginning at [fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair-use/](https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair-use/). This text, despite being called an overview, is really a more in-depth understanding of fair use than the brief introduction in _Writer/Designer_.

* PS: Have you seen our plentiful <a href="{{site.github_url}}/resources">Resources</a> page? Be sure to at least skim both the free/licensed sounds and music section and the audio-unit-specific advice and examples.
