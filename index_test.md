<h1>Welcome to <i>Composing Digital Media</i></h1>

This course is a course, of course (of course) and no one can forecast a course, of course, that is, of course, unless the course is a kind of SC:Ed...

More seriously, though, people, here's the plan:
> This course requires students to compose digital media while exploring the rhetorical, poetic, and political implications of multiple writing platforms. Students will learn how to compose a range of critical media objects using web-authoring languages, text, sound, images, and video in proprietary and open-source software. Classes will focus on theories of writing, composing, design, critique, delivery, and networked distributions; critique and analysis of digital media produced by professional and amateur digital media practitioners; and analysis and revisions of digital media composed by the students themselves.
