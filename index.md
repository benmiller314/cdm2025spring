    This course requires students to compose digital media while exploring the rhetorical, poetic, and political implications of multiple writing platforms. Students will learn how to compose a range of critical media objects using web-authoring languages, text, sound, and images, primarily in open-source software. Classes will focus on theories of writing, composing, design, critique, delivery, and networked distributions; critique and analysis of digital media produced by professional and amateur digital media practitioners; and analysis and revisions of digital media composed by the students themselves.

            <ul>
                <li>respond orally and in writing to students’ ideas and the ideas in texts about digital media and composing</li>
                <li>provide exercises for generating, analyzing, and revising multimodal texts</li>
                <li>provide links to extensive online resources for further individualized study</li>

                <li>encourage students to retry earlier exercises in later contexts, to support the development of mastery</li>

                <li>build flexibility into per-class and semester-long schedules, recognizing that the complexity of writing – including digital writing – means insights and lessons do not follow a linear order of development, but leap from teachable moment to teachable moment</li>
