## Feedback, Assessment, and Grades

This course uses a _contract grading system_, with a minimum grade based on baseline participation and a maximum grade based on a combination of ambitious process and excellent products. You can [download the full contract here](uploads/miller-grading-contract-cdm2025spring.docx) or expand the sections below; it is also included in the [full syllabus](uploads/2254 ENGCMP 0610 Composing Digital Media Miller Benjamin.pdf).

<details><summary>Rationale and introduction: What is this?</summary>
    <p>As composition theorist Peter Elbow has written in a number of places (see especially his &ldquo;Ranking, Evaluating, and Liking&rdquo;<a id="_ftnref1" href="#_ftn1" title="Elbow, Peter. &ldquo;Ranking, Evaluating, and Liking: Sorting out Three Forms of Judgment.&rdquo; <em>College English</em> 55.2 (1993): 187-206. This grading contract, including some of the language, has been adapted from Danielewicz, Jane and Peter Elbow. 'A Unilateral Grading Contract to Improve Learning and Teaching.' <em>College Composition and Communication</em> 61.2 (December 2009): 244-268, as well as the online appendix to that article (see their note 1); and from Reilly, Colleen A., and Anthony T. Atkins. &ldquo;Rewarding Risk: Designing Aspirational Assessment Processes for Digital Writing Projects.&rdquo; <em>Digital Writing: Assessment and Evaluation</em>, edited by Heidi McKee and D&agrave;nielle Nicole DeVoss, Computers and Composition Digital Press, 2013, http://ccdigitalpress.org/dwae/04_reilly.html."><span>*</span></a>), grades are a surprisingly crude way of measuring or producing learning: they reduce complex phenomena to a single letter or number, and thus obscure the differences between, say, proofreading skills and ability to support an argument. Some teachers might try to get around this by assigning percentages of their grades to particular skill-sets, but I find I can&rsquo;t know, in advance, what any one of you will need to work on: I want us to be free to give more targeted feedback, and set more targeted goals, than any pre-set percentage allows us to do. As I see it, each of you is here to become better than yourself, not better than anyone else. Grades distract from that, and distract from the particular reactions and suggestions that can help you improve.</p>
    <p>So to shift our attention away from grading &ndash; and therefore toward thoughtful assessment &ndash; I&rsquo;m going to do several things. First, I&rsquo;ll put the bulk of your final grade into process and participation: <em>concrete, observable behaviors</em>, not subjective judgments of quality. No matter where you start out, this playing field is level. Second, for each major unit of the course, we&rsquo;ll work as a class to develop the <em>baseline criteria </em>needed to demonstrate competency (not necessarily excellence) in that unit. <strong>If you participate consistently at this minimum level, I&rsquo;ll guarantee that your minimum grade for the course is a B.</strong> Your grade can go up from there for excellent work, toward which we&rsquo;ll set flexible and optional <em>aspirational criteria </em>within each unit &ndash; one of which will always be trying something new or risky, even if it doesn&rsquo;t pay off.</p>
    <p>Lastly, I&rsquo;ll keep the final tally of those criteria open <em>until the end of the semester</em>, as measured in a final portfolio. My goal is to help you develop competencies for which it may take several failures to reach success, and I don&rsquo;t want to penalize you by over-weighting an early project for lacking some skill you attained later on.</p>
    <p>I hope you take this as an opportunity to explore, to experiment, and to trust that you will learn something in the process: even if you try a new move and fail, you can (in the words of Samuel Beckett) "fail better" next time, without being penalized.</p>

</details> <!-- end of contract preamble -->
<details><summary>To earn a B for this course, you must...</summary>
    <p><strong>Approach the work</strong></p>
    <ol start="1">
        <li><u>Engage actively</u> to make the most of class-time. Everyone has an off day now and then, but to the best of your ability, you should be putting in the full 75 minutes of work for each class meeting or asynchronous assignment period. (I&rsquo;ll do my best to ensure you have a clear sense of what to work on, including extensions for if you finish early.) This means you must also be consistently prepared for class: read, annotate, and bring any required readings, and bring a notebook and whatever drafts, files, or research you'll need.</li>
        <li>During every workshop, push yourself to provide your class- and group-mates with <u>thorough, thoughtful feedback</u>. Taking their work seriously enough to both describe it and think hard about how it can be improved is crucial for your success, as well as theirs, in becoming better composers throughout this course. Note that this is not just about praise or criticism: ask questions, make connections, explore possibilities. Open space for them to do or say more.</li>
        <li><u>Work with your group-mates</u> to complete group assignments and exercises to the satisfaction of everyone in the group. Divide group assignments and time fairly, and complete, on time, all the work you take on. Note that this also means demanding satisfaction <em>from </em>your group mates: if one of you is slacking off, the whole group suffers. Let that person know.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Write and revise</strong></p>
    <ol start="4">
        <li>For every assignment, produce a substantial, thoughtful <u>product</u> that follows the guidelines in the prompt &ndash; including deadlines and all baseline criteria.</li>
        <li>Complete all assigned <u>readings</u> attentively enough that you could provide examples of key concepts; you may wish to mark up the readings or take notes as you go.</li>
        <li>Help to vet <u>baseline criteria</u> for each major project, so that you are confident you can meet those criteria in the time allotted. If something proposed seems aspirational, more of a stretch goal than a requirement, say so.</li>
        <li>Use the feedback provided by your instructor and your classmates to improve your projects. You don't have to make every change suggested, of course, because your work is yours, and after all, audiences will sometimes disagree. But you must take all feedback seriously, and your drafts (or reflections; see next bullet) should <u>show evidence that you&rsquo;ve carefully considered your respondents&rsquo; suggestions</u>: if a reader is confused or has an objection, don't ignore it, but instead try to clear up the confusion or incorporate and respond to the objection.</li>
        <li>When turning in revisions (as well as for any earlier draft on which it feels appropriate), attach a <u>brief note reflecting on what in particular you were trying to achieve</u> in that draft. e.g., Were there particular comments you were responding to? A genre feature or model you were trying to emulate? You can also use this note to acknowledge suggestions you consciously decided <em>not</em> to take, explaining your reasons. (This may, in fact, help you to discover your reasons.)</li>
        <li><u>Proofread</u> final drafts to eliminate surface errors and typos to the best of your ability. Use style guides and talk to classmates, me, or a Writing Center Consultant if you have questions.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Build a class community</strong></p>
    <ol start="10">
        <li><u>Show respect</u> for your classmates and your instructor. This includes taking each others&rsquo; ideas seriously; using language that honors others&rsquo; racial, ethnic, religious, political, economic, sexual, and gender identifications or positions; and refraining from distracting behaviors, such as gossiping, reading the news, or using electronic devices for non-class-related activities. Ensure that your cell phone doesn't ring during class.<u></u></li>
        <li><u>Attend scheduled conferences</u> with me or your Writing Center Consultant (if applicable), and come prepared to use the conference time productively. <strong>If I indicate in feedback that I would like you to schedule an appointment to talk with me, please reply within one week.</strong> A missed conference counts as 2/3 of an absence (see #13).</li>
        <li>
            <p><u>Avoid plagiarism</u> by (a) taking careful notes to help you distinguish between your own ideas and language and those you have borrowed from sources; (b) being generous about attributing ideas and acknowledging those whose work has influenced your own, i.e. by attempting to cite all sources correctly, even in first drafts; (c) mastering citation conventions and citing all sources correctly in all final drafts; and (d) never attempting to disguise another&rsquo;s work as your own, never purchasing someone else&rsquo;s writing services online for course credit, and never engaging in any other act of academic dishonesty.</p>
            <p>This is a collaborative class, in which we offer each other suggestions and constructive criticism. But we do so to clarify the expression of <em>original ideas</em> &ndash; never to substitute someone else's ideas for our own, or to impose our ideas on someone else. If you feel you&rsquo;re making a Fair Use of someone else&rsquo;s intellectual property, <u>include a rationale for your use in a reflection</u> that accompanies your drafts (see #8). This applies as well to AI-generated source materials you incorporate into projects you'll take credit for: provide your prompts, name your tools, explain your use.</p>
        </li>
        <li id="attendance-contract"><u>Be present.</u> For synchronous participation, be consistently on time for class, and be absent very rarely; for asynchronous participation (e.g. a makeup class after illness), complete a check-in at the beginning and/or end of your work-time, no later than five days after the equivalent class-meeting. Each missed class is equivalent to three &ldquo;absence tokens,&rdquo; and vice versa. Joining class after activities are underway earns one absence token, and missing more than 20 minutes of class &ndash; or completing async work between 5 and 7 days after it&rsquo;s assigned &ndash; earns two absence tokens (though you're still always welcome to come in, quietly). <br />Twelve absence tokens throughout the semester, nine during any one unit, or failing to turn in a timely peer review is a major breach of contract (see next section). Having more than 18 absence tokens (equivalent to six absences, or &frac14; of the classes for the term) could be grounds for failure, given the hands-on nature of the course. <strong>Please talk to me before we get to that point!</strong></li>
        <li><u>Submit a complete, revised portfolio</u> that meets all outlined requirements by the due date. The portfolio for this class will consist of three major projects (featuring sound, image, and web design), at least one with revision history and a selection of feedback; one additional consolidation project to which you have contributed significantly; and a reflective portfolio introduction. Details to follow, closer to the deadline.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><br /><em>If you fulfill all of these expectations, you are guaranteed a grade of at least a B overall.</em> I will do my best to keep you informed and afloat with regard to your successful participation. If you're ever in doubt about your contractual status, feel free to <a class="inline_disabled" href="mailto:millerb@pitt.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">email me</a> and/or drop by my <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://benmiller314.youcanbook.me" target="_blank" rel="noopener">office hours</a>.</p>
</details> <!-- end of baseline B section -->
<details><summary>Grades below a B</summary>
    <p>If you don&rsquo;t keep the contract, your contracted minimum grade for the course will be lowered as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><u>For minor breaches</u> (e.g. missing or not bringing in a short homework exercise, missing up to one sixth of the baseline criteria, or failing to acknowledge direct revision-suggestions): in each Unit, I will permit you one &ldquo;Mulligan&rdquo; &ndash; one minor misstep that will not break the contract. But two minor breaches during any Unit will lower your minimum grade by ⅓ of a letter, i.e. to a B&ndash;; another breach in the same unit or two minor breaches during the next Unit, and your minimum grade will be lowered further to a C+, and so on. These lowered minimum grades can still be exceeded by an exceptionally strong portfolio.</li>
        <li><u>For major breaches</u> (e.g. missing more than one sixth of a project&rsquo;s baseline criteria, failing to participate in peer review, not turning in a project reflection): no Mulligans; your minimum grade will immediately be lowered to a B&ndash; after the first major breach, C+ after the second, and so on. These lowered grades can still be exceeded by an exceptionally strong portfolio.</li>
        <li><u>For the final portfolio</u>: each day it is late, the minimum grade drops ⅓ of a letter.</li>
        <li><u>The attendance policy</u> is outlined above, in item #13 (though see also #11).</li>
        <li><strong>A minimum grade falling below a C-minus is grounds for failing the course.</strong> Please talk to me before we get to that point!<strong><br /></strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>I want to emphasize that I can empathize: I know there may well be important reasons in your life that you're not able to participate as fully in this class as may be my ideal or yours.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>If you have extenuating circumstances, and especially if you are having trouble accessing or processing the course materials, please let me know;<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>setting up the conditions for your success is important to me!</p>
    <p>Again, I will do my best to keep you informed and afloat with regard to patterns that threaten to break the contract: my goal is to keep everyone engaged, active, and learning. If you are ever in doubt about your contractual status, or want to talk about possible extensions or extenuations, feel free to<span>&nbsp;</span><a class="inline_disabled" href="mailto:millerb@pitt.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">send me an email</a><span>&nbsp;</span>or drop by my<span>&nbsp;</span><a class="inline_disabled external" href="https://benmiller314.youcanbook.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">office hours</a>.</p>
</details> <!-- end of below-B section -->
<details><summary>Grades above a B</summary>
    <p>There are two ways to earn a grade above a B: by demonstrating Excellence and Quality in your final <em>products</em>, and by demonstrating ambition in your <em>process</em> by meeting aspirational criteria. The best portfolios will likely involve both.</p>
    <p>While the former terms are, unavoidably, rather fuzzy, in my defense I can say only this:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>First, most grades in writing, even digital writing, are somewhat subjective &ndash; and at least by using this contract and the baseline / aspirational guides, I'm doing my best to limit and control the arbitrariness of such judgment. We will also collaboratively adjust the aspirational criteria for each unit, as they should vary with the genres, tools, and skillsets at hand.</li>
        <li>Second, I promise to do my very best to articulate, in particular instances, what I think would most help the piece in question achieve Excellence and Quality, and to invite peer feedback I can see, so my perspective isn&rsquo;t the only one considered. One of the characteristics of Excellent, High-Quality work is that it tends to stand out as its own self, original and often surprising, and it is therefore far harder to give guidance in general terms.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>To earn a grade above a B for ambitious process, <strong>you must make the case</strong> in your project reflections (or final-portfolio reflection) for how you have met the aspirational criteria.</em></p>
    <p>If your work is trending towards a better-than-B portfolio, I will do my best to let you know where you've leveled up over that line, so you can try to recapture and consolidate whatever was working so well. (Don't worry, I'll keep giving suggestions for where you can improve, as well, because I believe that even the best of us can.)</p>
</details> <!-- end of above-B section -->

Should you ever find yourself in doubt about your contractual status &ndash; whether your work is satisfactory for a B, unsatisfactory for a B, or excelling beyond the B-level, please feel free to <a href="mailto:millerb@pitt.edu">send me an email</a>, drop by my <a href="https://benmiller314.youcanbook.me">office hours</a>, or even set up a conference at a better time if the office hours don't work with your schedule.


## Attendance
As explained in the grading contract, [you are expected to attend every class if you are able](#attendance-contract "Jump to attendance section of grading contract"). We'll often break into small groups, which work very differently when there are three people rather than two (let alone one); and even when we're discussing as a full class or working solo in a studio space, that's time building shared community references (and sometimes assessment criteria or stretch goals) or getting individual feedback or advice in the moment of composition, all of which is harder to replicate at home or in office hours.

That said, I know life is complex, and we have a lot going on – including conferences, illnesses, families, and other legitimate claims on our time and energy. If you know in advance that you will not be able to attend, please let me know and we can try to arrange an alternative form of participation. If you must be absent unexpectedly, please try to reach out to me and your classmates as soon as you're able. It won't be the same as if you were here, but something may yet be gleaned as we try to catch you up.


## Inclusion and Access
I strive to set you up for success. If there are circumstances that may affect your performance in this class, _please let me know as soon as possible so that we can work together to develop strategies for succeeding_, which might include adapting assignments to meet both your needs and the requirements of the course.

I ask everyone in the class to help ensure that we can all learn in a supportive and respectful environment, including by using [gender-inclusive language](https://www.gsws.pitt.edu/resources/faculty-resources/gender-inclusivenon-sexist-language-statement-syllabi).

If you have a disability for which you are or may be requesting an accommodation, you are encouraged to contact both me and the Office of Disability Resources and Services, 140 William Pitt Union, 412-648-7890 / [drsrecep@pitt.edu](mailto:drsrecep@pitt.edu), as early as possible in the term. Disability Resources and Services will verify your disability and help determine reasonable accommodations for this course. For more information, visit [www.studentaffairs.pitt.edu/drs](https://www.studentaffairs.pitt.edu/drs).

For my part, I will work to ensure multiple ways of accessing class materials, including written lesson plans in screen-reader compliant html, alternative text for images, and transcriptions for recorded videos. Because proofreading the latter can be particularly time-consuming, I ask that you please [let me know](mailto:millerb@pitt.edu) early in the semester if you will be relying primarily on transcriptions to access the videos your classmates will produce: I can introduce digital tools like [otter.ai](https://otter.ai) and [rev.com](https://rev.com) that may help with the first draft.

While we're on the subject of email, I am obligated to include the standard statement on using your University-issued email address:
<details><summary>Click to expand.</summary>

<p>Each student is issued a University e-mail address (username@pitt.edu) upon admittance. This e-mail address may be used by the University for official communication with students. Students are expected to read e-mail sent to this account on a regular basis. Failure to read and react to University communications in a timely manner does not absolve the student from knowing and complying with the content of the communications.</p>
<p>The University provides an e-mail forwarding service that allows students to read their e- mail via other service providers (e.g., Hotmail, AOL, Yahoo). Students that choose to forward their e-mail from their pitt.edu address to another address do so at their own risk. If e-mail is lost as a result of forwarding, it does not absolve the student from responding to official communications sent to their University e-mail address. To forward e-mail sent to your University account, go to <a href="http://accounts.pitt.edu">http://accounts.pitt.edu</a>, log into your account, click on Edit Forwarding Addresses, and follow the instructions on the page. Be sure to log out of your account when you have finished. (For the full E-mail Communication Policy, go to <a href="https://www.bc.pitt.edu/policies/policy/09/09-10-01.html">www.bc.pitt.edu/policies/policy/09/09-10-01.html</a>.)</p>
</details>


## Title IX and Mandatory Reporting
The University is committed to combatting sexual misconduct. As a result, University faculty and staff members are required to report any instances of sexual misconduct – including harassment and sexual violence – to the University’ s Title IX office, both so that the victim may be provided appropriate resources/support options and so that the office can attempt to keep track of repeat offenders or other patterns of behavior on or around campus.

What this means is that as your instructor, I am required to report any incidents of sexual misconduct that are directly reported to me, or of which I am somehow made aware.

There are two important exceptions: a list of the designated University employees who, as counselors and medical professionals, do not have this reporting responsibility and can maintain confidentiality, can be found at [www.titleix.pitt.edu/report/confidentiality](https://www.titleix.pitt.edu/report/confidentiality). An important exemption to the reporting requirement exists for academic work: disclosures about sexual misconduct that are shared as part of an academic project, classroom discussion, or course assignment are not required to be disclosed to the University’ s Title IX office.

If you are the victim of sexual misconduct, Pitt encourages you to reach out to these resources: *Title IX Office: 412-648-7860 *SHARE @ the University Counseling Center: 412-648-7930 (8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. MF) and 412-648-7856 (after business hours). If you have a safety concern, please contact the University of Pittsburgh Police, 412-624-2121. Other reporting information is available at [titleix.pitt.edu/report-0](https://titleix.pitt.edu/report-0).

If you come to talk to me and I feel like it might be something I am required to report, I will say, “I am happy to listen and support you, but this discussion might fall under mandated reporting. Is that okay?’ The Title IX office aims to be very nice and, even if I report something you discussed with me as required, _Title IX cannot force you to do anything_. They will ask to talk with you, then they will present you with options: one will be to report behavior experienced against you; one will be to request through the University to keep said person who committed that behavior far away from you; and one will be to do nothing. They will also most likely inform you of our on-campus therapists’ office.


## Avoiding Plagiarism

This is a collaborative class, in which we offer each other suggestions and constructive criticism. However, the goal of all this collaboration is to clarify the expression of original ideas – never to substitute someone else's ideas for our own, or to impose our ideas on someone else.

To misrepresent the origins of an idea is plagiarism, and it is a problem both for your own learning and for the well-being of the community, which depends on mutual trust.

If you want to incorporate materials that others have created, you can do so if you give credit to your source. At a minimum, readers of your work should be able to get back to the original, so be sure to provide at least the author's identity; the original title; the publication venue; the date of publication and/or access; and a URL if appropriate. The English department has some useful resources at <a href="https://www.english.pitt.edu/undergraduate/plagiarism">www.english.pitt.edu/undergraduate/plagiarism</a>.

(And if you want to collaborate with an AI, there are ways to do so without sacrificing your learning. [See below](#artificial-intelligence) for starters, but let’s talk!)

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask, because Pitt takes a very hard stance on plagiarism. It could get you expelled. Here's an excerpt from the official Policy on Academic Integrity, to give you the flavor:

<blockquote>
    <p>Cheating/plagiarism will not be tolerated. Students suspected of violating the University of Pittsburgh Policy on Academic Integrity, from the February 1974 Senate Committee on Tenure and Academic Freedom reported to the Senate Council, will be required to participate in the outlined procedural process as initiated by the instructor. A minimum sanction of a zero score for the quiz or exam will be imposed.</p>

    <p>A student has an obligation to exhibit honesty and to respect the ethical standards of the profession in carrying out his or her academic assignments.  Without limiting the application of this principle, a student may be found to have violated this obligation if he or she: […]<ol start="8">
        <!--8--><li>Depends on the aid of others in a manner expressly prohibited by the faculty member, in the research, preparation, creation, writing, performing, or publication of work to be submitted for academic credit or evaluation.</li>
        <!--9--><li>Provides aid to another person, knowing such aid is expressly prohibited by the faculty member, in the research, preparation, creation, writing, performing, or publication of work to be submitted for academic credit or evaluation.</li>
        <!--10--><li>Presents as one's own, for academic evaluation, the ideas, representations, or words of another person or persons without customary and proper acknowledgment of sources.</li>
        <!--11--><li>Submits the work of another person in a manner which represents the work to be one's own.</li>
        <!--12--><li>Knowingly permits one's work to be submitted by another person without the faculty member's authorization.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
</blockquote>

You have the right to a fair hearing, and I’ll talk to you before I talk to anyone else, but it’s far easier just to avoid plagiarism in the first place. All clear cases of deliberate plagiarism will be referred to the appropriate Dean for disciplinary action, including an Academic Integrity Board hearing. For the University's full policy on Academic Integrity and the adjudication process for infringements, including plagiarism, go to <a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~provost/ai1.html">http://www.pitt.edu/~provost/ai1.html</a>.


## On Classroom Recordings
_Hat tip to Jess FitzPatrick for this language_

I do not currently plan to regularly record in-person or online discussions in this course. [Recording video or audio in Pennsylvania requires the consent of all participants.](https://www.rcfp.org/reporters-recording-guide/pennsylvania/) Students are also subject to PA law and are not allowed to record a class without permission of all participants. If a situation arises where our class or its members would vitally benefit from having sections recorded (visits with guest speakers, specific lectures, etc.), I will announce the intent to record through email / our Canvas announcements and at the start of the recording. Further, the recorded lecture may be used by the faculty member and the registered students only for internal class purposes and only during the term in which the course is being offered.


## On Artificial Intelligence

In this class, you are responsible for the integrity and accuracy of anything you turn in; if you draw on an outside source, I expect you to provide a citation that would allow me and other readers to return to that source and understand its context. Note that so far, I haven't said anything specific to AI: this is just a standard statement about academic honesty and courtesy.

In the case of a generative AI, including large language models (LLMs) like GPT/ChatGPT, BERT, or Sudowrite and image or audio generators like Stable Diffusion Dall-E, Mubert, and AIVA, an element of randomness means we can't go back directly to the original and encounter the same thing you did. Even so, the knowledge that you consulted such a model as part of your process adds important context to your work, much as a citation does, and our understanding of that context is further improved if you can share the prompt you submitted. (In some cases, it may even make sense to save the transcript of your generative session, e.g. to make your _sequence_ of prompts available as an appendix or upon request.)

I do not believe LLMs spell the end of writing as part of education – for one thing, the epistemic process of trying to figure out what you mean by trying to put it in language is often the greatest benefit of writing in the first place (see [Perl](https://compcomm.commons.gc.cuny.edu/feltsense/part-one-what-is-felt-sense/ "Perl, Sondra. Felt Sense: Writing with the Body. Boynton/Cook, 2004."); [Vee](https://compositionstudiesjournal.files.wordpress.com/2023/06/vee.pdf "Vee, Annette. “Large Language Models Write Answers.” Composition Studies, vol. 51, no. 1, Spring 2023, pp. 176–81.")), and LLMs' outputs aren't designed for that kind of learning. Working to find the right prompt, though, has some potential for writing-to-learn, and so does figuring out what _doesn't_ work for you in an LLM-generated response. These are still early days, and AI-assisted writing isn't going away; rather, how to learn and teach writing alongside AI is an open question that I'm genuinely curious about.

Therefore, I will allow AI-assisted submissions in this class, provided that you agree to the following:

1. Along with your submission, you will acknowledge and name the AI tool you used, and describe what you used it for. If you are copying text or an image directly from the model's output, include the text of your prompt in an appendix or footnote.

2. Whenever possible, you will avoid the temptation to accept a single default output, instead requesting multiple responses from the model and selecting or remixing among them. This will require you to draw on your own discernment and allow you to write reflectively about your choices.

3. You must recognize that LLMs are not search engines: they hallucinate and fabricate citation-like structures without regard to their actual existence – even when they come attached to hyperlinks. Any references, as well as article or book summaries, should be checked for accuracy.

4. The work you submit is ultimately your responsibility, and should serve your goals in light of your understanding of your task and your audience. Therefore, you should review and edit any AI-generated output to ensure you feel satisfied that it represents your views, your voice, and your learning goals.

NB: if the core software you are using for your project includes built-in automated _modifying effects_, such as spellcheck (for text), reverb (for audio), blur (for visuals), and the like – and especially where they use reproducible settings rather than language-first prompts – you do not have to attempt multiple responses first, or necessarily share your exact settings. You may want to do so anyway, for your own learning! But that is more or less a different situation than the use of GenAI models.

I'm also happy to talk more about any of this!
